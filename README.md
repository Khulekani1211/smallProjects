# In this folder, I have all my small projects.

In this repo I mainly work on small projects for the purpose of testing my coding skills. Most of the projects will be FrontEnd Web Development focused, but I do work on coding using Java, Python and C#.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that when working with only one container with information in card style, by designing the layout with Mobile-first workflow, there is no need to worry about making the page responsive for larger screens because the card layout appears well in most screen sizes.

### Continued development

I plan on turning this project to a more personal one. To add my own social links to the buttons and encorporate this with my Personal Portfolio Website.
